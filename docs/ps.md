# Multilingual Content Generation Crisis

## Challenge Overview
Design a lightweight, multilingual AI system to generate educational content across all 22 scheduled Indian languages, including key regional dialects like Bhojpuri and Santali.

## The Problem
Rural Indian students face significant barriers in accessing quality educational content in their native languages. Current educational AI systems are predominantly English-focused and fail to serve the linguistic diversity of India's student population. There's an urgent need for a system that can generate culturally relevant, curriculum-aligned educational content across multiple languages while operating on resource-constrained devices.

## Core Requirements

- **Script Accuracy Assurance** - Guarantee correct usage of characters, numbers, and symbols for complex subjects such as mathematics and science across all supported scripts
- **Age-Appropriate Scaling** - Adapt curriculum topics (e.g., Photosynthesis) to different grade levels (Class 3, 8, 12) with appropriate depth, vocabulary, and examples
- **Cultural Relevance Embedding** - Integrate region-specific festivals, stories, and local references while maintaining a pan-Indian educational perspective
- **Code-Mixing Fluency** - Seamlessly handle mixed-language content (e.g., Hindi-English, Punjabi-English) without losing readability or comprehension
- **Curriculum Alignment** - Strictly adhere to NCERT, CBSE, and state board standards with factual accuracy above 95%
- **Accessibility Support** - Provide learning-friendly outputs for students with dyslexia, visual impairments, or other learning challenges
- **Offline Optimization** - Run efficiently on low-resource devices (4–8 GB RAM), ensuring smooth operation in low-connectivity or offline rural settings

## Technical Challenge
Develop a compact multilingual Large Language Model (1–2 billion parameters) that solves the fundamental trade-off between model capability and resource constraints. Your solution must employ advanced techniques such as:

### Model Architecture Innovation
- Knowledge distillation from larger multilingual models while preserving cultural nuances
- Novel quantization strategies that maintain script accuracy for complex mathematical notation
- Efficient attention mechanisms optimized for code-switching scenarios

### Training and Data Engineering
- Curriculum-aligned training data synthesis across 22 Indian languages
- Balanced representation learning that prevents dominant language bias
- Few-shot learning capabilities for regional dialects with limited training data

### Fine-tuning on Educational Corpora
- Participants will be provided with NCERT curriculum data, regional textbooks, and culturally-relevant educational content for fine-tuning to ensure domain expertise and pedagogical accuracy

### Deployment Optimization
- Model compression techniques that preserve educational content quality
- Memory-efficient inference strategies for 4-8 GB RAM constraints
- Latency optimization for real-time content generation in offline environments

### Post-Training Optimization
- Fine-tuning optimization techniques including LoRA, QLoRA, and parameter-efficient methods to maintain quality while reducing computational requirements

### Cultural and Linguistic Intelligence
- Context-aware cultural adaptation without stereotyping
- Accurate handling of linguistic variations within the same script family
- Preservation of educational intent across language translations

## Success Metrics

- **Machine Translation Quality** - BLEU, METEOR, chrF/chrF++ - Target: ≥95% accuracy across 15+ languages
- **Summarization Quality** - ROUGE-1/2/L - Target: ≥0.8 vs expert summaries
- **Symbol & Notation Accuracy** - Symbol Accuracy Rate (SAR) - Target: ≥98%
- **Script Fidelity** - CER, WER - Target: ≥95% (CER ≤1–2% for complex scripts)
- **Code-Mixing Robustness** - Accuracy Drop Ratio - Target: ≤10%
- **Cultural Relevance** - Cultural Adequacy Score (Likert) - Target: ≥4/5, κ ≥0.6

## Bonus Features

- **Natural Conversational Teaching** - Teachers engage in free-flowing educational conversations with students using advanced dialogue systems
- **Voice-Controlled Bot Customization** - Teachers and students can verbally customize Bot appearance, teaching style, and personality traits
- **Multi-Speaker Classroom Management** - Handle multiple student voices simultaneously in group learning scenarios
- **Emotional Voice Response** - Bot responds to student emotional cues detected through voice tone and adjusts teaching approach accordingly
- **Voice-Based Content Creation** - Teachers can create new lessons by speaking to the bot, which then generates appropriate visual and interactive content
